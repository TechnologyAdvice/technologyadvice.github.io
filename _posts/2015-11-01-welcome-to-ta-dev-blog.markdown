Welcome to the [TechnologyAdvice](http://www.technologyadvice.com) developer blog!

The team at TA is constantly working on new projects and always looking for ways to expand and give back to the open source and development communities. As such we have a large collection of [open source repositories](https://github.com/TechnologyAdvice/) which we have been maintaining.

However, we felt we should also share some of our internal discussions, thoughts, ponderings and tutorials. As such we have launched this blog to allow us to post helpful meanderings to anyone interested (or bored enough) to read them :)

Enjoy!
