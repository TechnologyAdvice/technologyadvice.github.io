The goal of this project is to provide a platform for all members of the [TechnologyAdvice](http://www.technologyadvice.com) development team to contribute to a blog dedicated to topics surrounding work at TA.

## Contributing

To contribute to the blog please clone this repo locally. Create a branch for the blog post you would like to write with the following format:

```

To view your post install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and from the root run `jekyll serve`.

When you have written your post and feel it is complete, submit a PR with basic information. Have someone else on the team review the PR and (when ready) accept it.

Once the post has been thoroughly reviewed and approved merging into `master` will publish the post on the live blog.
